Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The degree is 3 because the element 2 is repeated 3 times.
So [2,2,3,1,4,2] is the shortest subarray, therefore returning 6.


SOLLUTION:

class Solution {
public:
    int findShortestSubArray(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        unordered_map<int,int>mp; //store the frequency of each element present in the array
        int temp=0,n=nums.size();
        for(auto &i:nums){
            mp[i]++;
            if(mp[i]>temp) 
                temp=mp[i]; //find max occurnace element in array
        }
        if(temp==1)
            return 1;
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        for(auto &i:mp){
            if(i.second == temp){ //iterating over all the elments having max occurance
                int l=0,r=n-1;
                while(l<=r && nums[l]!=i.first) //finding left most occurance of that element
                    l++;
                while(l<=r && nums[r]!=i.first) //finding right most occurance of that element
                    r--;
                ans=min(ans,r-l+1);//storing min length subarray->of all the element with max occurance            
            }
        }        
        return ans;  
    }
};
